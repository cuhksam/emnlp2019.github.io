## About Brussels

Situated in the heart of Europe, the city of Brussels is an international, multicultural city with a rich historical past. Brussels is the home of various European institutions, and is known for its gastronomy, architectural heritage, and comic book heroes.

Brussels is easy to reach by air, road and rail, but also easy to move around in. In this compact city, many places are within walking distance, or a short ride away by tram, bus or metro. And if you’re staying near the city centre, walking is a wonderful way to discover historical Brussels. More details about transportation to and within Brussels can be found on this [page](https://visit.brussels/en/article/Getting-to-Brussels).

## Social Event

On the evening of Saturday, November 3rd, the EMNLP 2018 social event will take place at the [Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium](https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en). Four museums, housed in a single building, will welcome the EMNLP delegates with their prestigious collection of 20,000 works of art.

## Childcare Grants

ACL 2017 and NAACL 2018 provided on-site daycare to participants attending the conference at a subsidized rate. However, it was under-utilized at those conferences.
