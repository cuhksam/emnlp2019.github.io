<span style="font-weight: bolder;font-size: larger;">Call For System Demonstrations</span>

The EMNLP 2018 System Demonstration Program Committee invites proposals for the Demonstrations Program. Submissions may range from early research prototypes to mature production-ready systems. Of particular interest are publicly available open-source or open-access systems. We would like to strongly encourage demonstrations of industrial systems as long as they prove technologically innovative given the current state of the art of theory and applied research in computational linguistics.

## Topics 

Areas of interest include all topics related to theoretical and applied computational linguistics, such as (but not limited to) the topics listed in the conference [call for papers](/calls/papers/). Accepted submissions will be published in a companion volume of the EMNLP 2018 conference proceedings, and will be presented during a demo session with an accompanying poster. 

The systems may be of the following kinds:        
- Natural Language Processing systems or system components
- Application systems using language technology components
- Software tools for computational linguistics research
- Software for demonstration or evaluation
- Software supporting learning or education
- Tools for data visualization and annotation
- Development tools

Developers should outline the design of their system and provide sufficient details to allow the evaluation of its validity, quality, and relevance to computational linguistics. Pointers to web sites running a demo preview will also be helpful. For non web-based demos, it is possible to submit a short (~2 minute) screencast video demonstrating the system. This screencast will be used to evaluate the paper, but won't be published unless requested. We encourage the authors to include visual aids (e.g., screenshots, snapshots, or diagrams) in the paper. However, there will be a place on the START website to upload additional material, if needed. If you choose to submit a screencast, please upload the video to some hosting site (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.) and include the link in your submission. Demo submissions should also clearly indicate if any computer equipment is expected to be provided by the local organizer. If so, please specify desired hardware platform, hard disk and memory capacity, operating system and other software needed in order to run the demo.

<h5>Note: All deadlines are calculated at 11:59pm Pacific Daylight Savings Time (UTC -7h).</h5>

## Submission Information
Submissions may consist of 6 pages (including references). Papers must conform to the official EMNLP guidelines which are contained in the [LaTeX style files](/downloads/emnlp18-latex.zip) and the [Word template](/downloads/emnlp18-word.zip). Submissions will be electronic in PDF format through the [START conference management system](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2018/demos/).

## Reviewing Policy
Reviewing will be single-blind,  so authors do not need to conceal their identity. The paper should include the authors’ names and affiliations. Self-references are also allowed.

## Demonstration Chairs
- Eduardo Blanco, University of North Texas, USA
- Wei Lu, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore
